    <p>
      There has to be a tree. There has to be <br />
      a sky. There has to be a chicken-hawk <br />
      skating the dust rising out of a thresher. <br />
      A ploughboy walking with a turtle <br />
      in the head-high corn. There has to be a pool <br />
      with a swirly slide entering the water. <br />
      A chain-link cut by the field where I took <br />
      Kerri-Ann to the river when the river <br />
      was flooded. A burnt knife lettering <br />
      her knee. And a song being played—<br />
      All the girls are gone, All the head-strong <br />
      good country girls are gone—from the window <br />
      of a painted Accord. Her father standing drunk<br />
      in the screen porch watching us dance. <br />
      There has to be light falling into his body. <br />
      And a muskie we pull from the mud puddles <br />
      under the tracks. A reason we throw it <br />
      in the pool where it wobbles and floats <br />
      in the shivering wave-lines. Her father still <br />
      watching us dance in his sleep. There has to be <br />
      a fight, a cross-fade of landscape surrounding <br />
      those liquor-marked breaths. Him catching <br />
      her thigh. The two of them wishing to god <br />
      they were drunker. And the black lines <br />
      of telephone wires rise quiet as old men <br />
      or grocery store crosses. The scarecrow <br />
      in silhouette losing its face in the hyper-<br />
      colored dust and the clouds. There has to be <br />
      light. And a circling car. And a song <br />
      moving out of his body like something <br />
      he names. A chicken-hawk rising <br />
      on dust trails over the ditch where the boy <br />
      now plays. The river still flooded. <br />
      The dissipated clouds in late-day in awe <br />
      of their own color fading. There has to be <br />
      a flood. And a promise of love. And a fish <br />
      in the pool, and the pool gone dark <br />
      where the turtle glides under the leaves.      <br />
