  <p class='section-content clearfix'>
    My name is Kai Carlson-Wee and I am a poet. I was born and raised in Minnesota and now live in California. Over the last ten years I’ve written poems and stories about traveling around the country. I’ve hopped freight trains, hitchhiked, road tripped, and spent a few years in the northern Cascades. This is my website. Feel free to check out my work and leave me a note if you want to say hi.
